1. Three new things I learned from AI while working on this task:

I learned how to link vertical scrolling to horizontal movement, so the page scrolls sideways instead of up and down.

I learned how to collect elements (like background images) into an array and control their movement together with JavaScript.

I learned the importance of layering content and visuals in CSS so that text and images stay in their own spaces and don’t overlap while scrolling.

2.Where I had to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions:

Copilot’s can provide necessary codes however these codes can also be tricky because It's either
provide you with codes that it recommends,not what you ideally preffer.
Futhermore Copilot’s can also be biase in terms of providing code which leads to be more AI generated codes rather than developing your own codes.

3. Difference between using Copilot to generate code vs. using it as a learning partner:

When using Copilot to generate code, it can give me something that works, but I might not understand why it works or if it’s the best solution.

4. Three risks of relying too much on AI when learning at HackYourFuture:

I might copy code without fully understanding it, which can slow down my learning in the long run.

AI-generated code might have errors or bad practices that I wouldn’t notice if I rely on it too much.

I could become dependent on AI and not develop my own problem-solving and debugging skills, which are essential as a programmer.
