        <h2>Spotting the Differences</h2>
        <p>
          At first glance, seals and sea lions look very similar. Both are
          marine mammals with flippers, whiskers, and playful personalities. But
          they have some key differences!
        </p>

        />
        <p>
          <strong>Seals</strong> have small ear holes and move by wriggling on
          their bellies. Their flippers are short, which makes them clumsy on
          land but fast in water.

          class="animal-img"
        />
        <p>
          <strong>Sea lions</strong> have visible ear flaps and long, strong
          front flippers. They can "walk" on land by rotating their back
          flippers and often make loud barking sounds.

        <h2>Did You Know?</h2>
        <p>
          Sea lions can hold their breath for up to 20 minutes while diving-
          that's longer than a dolphin!
